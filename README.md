# Internal_Gear_Pump
This project involves development of a demonstration model of a gear based machine element (the Internal Gear pump) used for an animated education video and fabricable with additive manufacturing designed parametrically with IceSl as Lua script.

This projects aims at understanding the principle behind the 3D printing technologies, how the scripted models are devloped, how slicing of the models are interpreted, and by end of the project the parametrical model is readily available for to be 3D printed.
